[Crunch] (http://crunch.co.uk) is an online accountancy firm based in the UK. They not only provide a slick user interface, but have exposed a useful REST api.

This open source project provides a simple .NET api to access the crunch REST Api.

(Note that the API is not yet ready for use, it is a work in progress. I have only checked it in for backup)
