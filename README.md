[Crunch] (http://crunch.co.uk) is an online accountancy firm based in the UK. They not only provide a slick user interface, but have exposed a useful REST api.

This open source project provides a simple .NET api to access the crunch REST Api. 
You can download it from https://www.nuget.org/packages/Crunch.DotNet 

:information_source: Note that the API is not yet ready for use, it is a work in progress.

:warning: **THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL API from Crunch.co.uk although they have been made aware of it's existance** :warning:

_ _You will need to engage with the Crunch developer program (https://developer.crunch.co.uk/) in order to use this API_ _
