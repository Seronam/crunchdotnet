    <description>Provides a simple .NET api for access the REST API of accountancy firm Crunch.co.uk

At the moment awaiting testing of the 'write' side of the api, it has only been tested with the read side.  

*** THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL API from Crunch.co.uk although they have been made aware of it's existance ***

You will need to engage with the Crunch developer program (https://developer.crunch.co.uk/) in order to use this API
